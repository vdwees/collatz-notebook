    "I had a bit of free time this holiday season, so of course I spent some of it getting caught up on the Veratasim channel on YouTube. Unfortunately, this resulted in second-degree burns from the most dangerous problem in mathematics: 3x+1, also known as the Collatz conjecture.\n",

    "Another way of saying the conjecture is that if you multiply a number by three and then add 1 to the least significant digit repeatedly, the number of significant digits will always converge to 1.\n",

    "I'm using this form below, because I think it helps to demonstrate the dynamics of the problem more intuitively. In this arrangement, you can see how information can only flow from right to left."

    "- The bit on the right edge right initially moves left at 4x, it is already in the equivalent of the 1, 4, 2, 1 loop.\n",
    "- The left edge of the graph is growing at a rate of 3x.\n",
    "- Towards the bottom left of the graph, the edges converge to into the stable and familiar 4x or 1, 4, 2, 1 loop.\n",
    "- On occasion, the right edge fails to move left at 4x. If the two least significant digits on the right are ◾◾ (11 in binary), then the right edge will move left only at 2x. Otherwise, it will move left at least 4x, and sometimes much more.\n",
